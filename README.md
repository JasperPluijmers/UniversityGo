# UniversityGo

Hello thank you for checking out this repository. This can be used to play a game of Go over the network.  
You can build the project with the Main class within the java root as main class or run the Main class from your IDE (tested only in Intellij)  
You can also run UniversityGo.jar located in the main folder.  
Running it should guide you into starting a Server or Client, have fun!
